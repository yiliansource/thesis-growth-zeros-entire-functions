# An Introduction to Entire Functions

## 3.1 Growth, Order, and Zeros

Theorem 1.1 - (Jensen) connection between zero moduli and function modulus
(Only really need to prove the alternative statement)

Note 1.1 - On the proof of theorem 1.1

Note 1.2 - Theorem 1.1 implies (roughly) that the more zeros an entire function has, the faster it must grow

Definition 1.1 - Order of an entire function

Note 1.4 - Explanation of order

Definition 1.2 - Exponent of convergence of zeros

Theorem 1.2 - Exponent of convergence of zeros <= finite order
~ Jensen (alt)

Note 1.5 - Finite order is necessary in theorem 1.2

Theorem 1.3 - (Hadamard) For entire functions of finite order p, f(z) = e^Q(z) P(z), where Q polynomial, deg q <= p, P canonical Weierstrass product (abbrv WCP)
~ Weierstrass, Lemma v BC

Lemma - (Borel-Carathéodory) Maximum modulus for real part of holomorphic function
~ Lemma v Schwarz

Theorem 1.4 - Relationship exponent of convergence p_1 and finite order p of WCP
(idk if i need this)
~ Theorem 1.2, Hadamard

Note 1.7 - Explanation why degree doesnt blow up for entire functions of finite order

Theorem 1.5 - If entire f has non-integer, finite order p, then p = p_1.
~ Theorem 1.2, 1.3, 1.4

Theorem 1.6 - If entire f has non-integer, finite order p then f has infinitely many zeros
~ Theorem 1.5

Note 1.8 - In Hadamard factorization, growth of f is determined by growth of P (if order not an integer), if is an integer then growth of e^Q may dominate P (but not necessarily)

Theorem 1.7 - f entire function finite order p, then f' has order p
(i will prove this using Theorem 2.1)

Theorem 1.8 - (Borel) Existence of borel exceptional values

Note 1.9 - Definition of borel exceptional values, relation to picard exceptional values

Note 1.10 - Exclusion of zero order functions

Example 1.1 - Properties of f(z) = e^z cos(sqrt(z))

## 3.2 Growth, Coefficients, and Type

Theorem 2.1 - Connection between order of entire function and coefficients in power series

Note 2.1 - Remark on above connection (we can use this powerful theorem to deduce elementary properties about order)

Definition 2.1 - Type of entire function with finite positive order

Definition 2.2 - Definition of growth (a, b) of an entire function

Theorem 2.2 - Relation between order, type and growth

Note 2.2 - f and f' have the same type

Definition 2.3 - Maximum term mu(r) of entire function

Theorem 2.3 - f entire transcendental function with finite order, then log M(r) ~ log mu(r).

Corollary 2.4 - Limits including mu(r)

## 3.4 Composition of entire functions

Theorem 4.1 - (Pólya) When can g o h be of finite order, for entire functions g, h

Theorem 4.2 - (Bohr) Maximum modulus of analytic function "controls" size of image of unit ball

Note 4.1 - Motivation for above theorem

Note 4.2 - ?

Note 4.3 - Example when a certain case of Pólyas theorem can occurr

Theorem 4.3 - f o f = g, g of finite order, not a polynomial, takes some value only finitely often => f is not entire

Note 4.4 - Example of above theorem: g(z) := e^z, and note that theorem is wrong in the real-analytic sense
