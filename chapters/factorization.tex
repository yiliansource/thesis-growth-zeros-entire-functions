\begin{theorem} [Weierstrass]
    Let $(z_j)_{j \in \N}$ be a sequence in $\C$ without accumulation points. Then there exists an entire function $P$ (called the \emph{Weierstrass canonical product} formed from said sequence) that has zeros precisely at $z_j, j \in \N$, with multiplicities equal to how often $z_j$ occurs in the sequence.

    Furthermore, if $f$ is any other entire function satisfying the above, then there exists an entire function $g$ such that
    $$ f = e^g P. $$
\end{theorem}

\todo{Short remark on how Hadamard refines Weierstrass (for functions of finite order).}

\begin{lemma}[Borel-Carath√©odory]
    Let $f$ be analytic in $\cl{B(0, R)}$ and let
    $$ M(r) = \max_{\vert z \vert = r} \vert f(z) \vert, \quad A(r) = \max_{\vert z \vert = r} \Re f(z). $$
    Then, for $0 < r < R$,
    $$ M(r) \leq \frac{2r}{R - r} A(R) + \frac{R + r}{R - r} \vert f(0) \vert $$
    and, if additionally $A(R) \geq 0$, then for $n \in \N$
    $$ \max_{\vert z \vert = r} \vert f^{(n)}(z) \vert \leq \frac{2^{n+2} n! R}{(R - r)^{n+1}} (A(R) + \vert f(0) \vert). $$
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Hadamard]
    Let $f$ be an entire function of finite order $\rho$ with zeros $(z_j)_{j \in \N}$ and $f(0) \neq 0$. Then there exists a polynomial $Q$ with $\deg Q \leq \rho$, such that
    $$ f = e^Q P, $$
    where $P$ is the Weierstrass canonical product formed from the zeros of $f$.
