\subsection{Growth}

\begin{definition}
    Let $f \in H(\C)$. Then $f$ is said to be of \emph{growth} $(a, b)$ if
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\rho_f < a$, or
        \item $\rho_f = a$ and $\tau_f \leq b$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{example} \label{exm:order-and-type}
    For $\rho, \tau \in (0, \infty)$, the function
    $$ f(z) \coloneqq \exp {\tau z^\rho} $$
    is of order $\rho$ and type $\tau$.

    We have already seen in \Cref{rem:order-zero} that polynomials are of order zero.

    The function
    $$ f(z) \coloneqq \exp \exp z $$
    is of infinite order, since for any $m \in M$
    $$ M_f(r) \geq \exp \exp r \geq \exp (m! r^m), $$
    therefore $\rho_f \geq m$, and thus $\rho_f = \infty$.
\end{example}

\todo{I do not really need to introduce growth ... maybe just move the examples somewhere else and scratch the definition.}
