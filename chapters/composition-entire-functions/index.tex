\chapter{Composition of Entire Functions}
\label{ch:composition-entire-functions}

As seen by \Cref{prop:algebraic-properties-order}, the sum or product of two entire functions of finite order is again of finite order. This is not the case when composition is involved; indeed, consider the function $f(z) \coloneqq \exp \exp z \in H(\C)$, which is of infinite order, yet is the composition of two functions of order $1$.
