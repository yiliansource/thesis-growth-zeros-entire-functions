\chapter{Composition of Entire Functions}
\label{ch:composition-entire-functions}

As seen by \Cref{prop:order-sum-product-estimate}, the sum of two entire functions of finite order is again of finite order. One can similarly show that this is also true for the product of such functions. However it is no longer the case when composition is involved; indeed, consider the function $f(z) \coloneqq \exp \exp z \in H(\C)$, which is of infinite order, yet is the composition of two functions of order $1$.
