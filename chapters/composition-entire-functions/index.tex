\chapter{Composition of entire functions}
\label{ch:composition-entire-functions}

As seen by \Cref{prop:algebraic-properties-order}, the order of the sum or product of two entire functions is reasonably bounded by the order of the functions involved. This is not the case when composition is involved. Indeed, consider $\exp \exp z$, which has infinite order, yet is the composition of two functions of order $1$.
