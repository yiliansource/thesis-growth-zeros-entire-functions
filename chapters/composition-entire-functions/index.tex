\chapter{Composition of Entire Functions}
\label{ch:composition-entire-functions}

As seen by \Cref{prop:order-sum-product-estimate}, the order of the sum or product of two entire functions of finite order is bounded above by the higher of the respective two orders. This is no longer the case when composition is involved; indeed, consider the function $f(z) \coloneqq \exp \exp z \in H(\C)$, which is of infinite order, yet is the composition of two functions of order $1$. 

The results of this section are based on Segal \cite{segal-complex-analysis}.
