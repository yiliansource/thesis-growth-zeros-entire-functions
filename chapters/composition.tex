\begin{theorem}[PÃ³lya]
    Let $g, h$ be entire. For the order of $g \circ h$ to be finite, it must hold that either
    \begin{enumerate}[i.]
        \item $h$ is a polynomial and $g$ of finite order, or
        \item $h$ is of finite order, not a polynomial, and $g$ is of order zero.
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{theorem}
    Let $g$ be an entire function of finite order, not a polynomial, which takes some value $w$ only finitely often. Suppose further that there exists $f$ such that $f \circ f = g$. Then $f$ is not entire.
